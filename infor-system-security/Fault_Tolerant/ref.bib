abstract = {The fault-tolerant control problem belongs to the domain of complex control systems in which inter-control-disciplinary information and expertise are required. This paper outlines the state of the art in a field which remains largely a theoretical topic with most application studies based upon aerospace systems. The directions in which the subject is going are summarised and some pointers are given as to the likely future issues and where new research effort is required. The paper provides a basic literature review covering most areas of fault-tolerant control.}
