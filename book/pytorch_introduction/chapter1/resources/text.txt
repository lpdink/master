Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I′m moving on
I've been living too fast
And I′ve been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

This big old world sure got me running round
Heard a voice that told me, "Settle down"
With the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I'm homeward bound

As I wondered through the pines
The whisperings, they tell of the many before me
Who tried and fell
Seeking fortune and ways to get to glory days
Looking for a place in this old world

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I′m moving on
I′ve been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I′m gone
(Take it over there)

Desert road, desert plain
I have seen so much pain
Now I see into the eyes of a girl
No more, no more, cruel world

On the dusty trail I saw a vapor light
Was it mirage? Don't know but it seemed right
I felt mission, I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Go to her away from this cruel world

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I′m moving on
I've been living too fast
And I′ve been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
